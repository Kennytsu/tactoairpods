# 🚀 TactoLearn LLM Integration - Setup Instructions

## ✅ What's Been Added

Your TactoLearn Negotiation Intelligence Agent now has **full LLM integration**! Here's what's new:

### 🤖 **New LLM-Powered Features**
- **AI-generated supplier responses** using OpenAI or Anthropic
- **Intelligent sentiment analysis** of conversations
- **Dynamic feedback generation** with personalized recommendations
- **Fallback to template responses** if LLM fails

### 📁 **New Files Created**
- `.env` - Environment configuration file
- `mcp_host/tools/llm_service.py` - LLM integration service
- `test_llm.py` - Test script for LLM functionality

### 🔧 **Updated Files**
- `simulate_supplier_response.py` - Now uses LLM for responses
- `summarize_negotiation_transcript.py` - Now uses LLM for sentiment analysis
- `generate_feedback.py` - Now uses LLM for feedback generation
- `pyproject.toml` - Added OpenAI and Anthropic dependencies
- `README.md` - Updated with LLM configuration instructions

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### 1. **Add Your API Key**
Edit the `.env` file and replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual API key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
```

**OR** if you prefer Anthropic:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-actual-api-key-here
LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic
```

### 2. **Test the LLM Integration**
```bash
python test_llm.py
```

This will verify that your API key works and the LLM integration is functioning.

### 3. **Run the Agent**
```bash
# Start the host
python mcp_host/host.py

# In another terminal, start the client
python mcp_client/client.py mcp_host/host.py
```

## 🎉 **What You'll Notice**

### **Before (Template-based):**
- Supplier responses were pre-written templates
- Sentiment analysis was keyword-based
- Feedback was generic and template-driven

### **After (LLM-powered):**
- Supplier responses are **dynamic and contextual**
- Sentiment analysis is **intelligent and nuanced**
- Feedback is **personalized and detailed**
- Responses adapt to **supplier data and conversation history**

## 🔄 **Fallback Behavior**

If the LLM fails (API issues, rate limits, etc.), the agent automatically falls back to the original template-based responses, so it will always work!

## 🚀 **Ready to Use**

Once you add your API key, your TactoLearn agent will be a **true AI-powered negotiation trainer** that provides realistic, intelligent responses based on your supplier data!
